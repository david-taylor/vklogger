In the interests of maintaining the existance of the original site, site-captures and anything else that will help to re-create the functionality is requested for input. Development environment is a LAMP or WAMP based with PHP7 support. HTML5 & CSS3 are the minimum visual levels with Acmescript/Javascript and AJAX (not sure which framework - currently YUI) for client-side support. Java itself is not to be supported. Perl on the otherhand could be threaded within.
